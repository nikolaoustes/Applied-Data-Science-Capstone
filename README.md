**Winning Space Race With Data Science**

This project is part of the Applied Data Science Capstone which is the final course of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The project tries to analyse the SpaceX past launches records and to reveal insights regarding successful launches. According to different providers, rocket launches cost up to 165 million dollars. SpaceX reuses the first stage of the rocket and therefore can save a lot of money with their advertisements showing costs of 62 million dollars. The main objective of this project is to determine if the first stage of the rocket will land successfully and eventually the cost of a launch. This information can be used if other companies want to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

The global activity of the rocket launch industry grows rapidly and Data Science can play a significant role in optimizing the attempts by uncovering various insights. As this project relies on Data Science, a set of related methodologies were followed for collecting, manipulating and analysing data. Exploratory Data Analysis was performed for exploring the data and revealing insights. Data Visualizations with Matplotlib, Interactive Maps with Folium and Interactive Dashboards with Plotly were created allowing us to visualize and determine the relationships among different features. Finally Machine Learning was used for creating classifiers that predict the mission outcome and thus allowing us to make recommendations.

**If you are interested in looking to a document where you can find a summary of this project including the methodologies followed, visualizations and explanations you can find a slide deck PDF file ("Winning Space Race with Data Science.pdf") which is intended to be a more detailed report in ppt format rather than just a presentation (covers the needs of the course).**

Overall, this was a very interesting project and there is a lot more room and potential to work on for answering more questions. However, for consistency this project is only limited to the needs of the course. I would strongly recommend to anyone who is interested in Data Science and wants to learn, to take the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. I have learnt a lot and interesting things about how a Data Scientist should think and work, the tools to use and finally how to tell interesting stories through the data for revealing insights, answering questions and finally solving problems by making recommendations. If you do take the course I wish you a very good luck and enjoy it! :)

Here are some examples of landing attempts:
